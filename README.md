# Zenith_Hackathon

 I recently participated in Zenith 4.0, a national-level hackathon organized by YMCA University, Faridabad, on 25–26 April 2025, where my team and I built an AI-based Herbal Medicinal Recommendation System.
🔍✨ Our project featured:
Real-time herb identification using a live camera feed
Integration with Google Maps to locate nearby herbs in the environment
Smart recommendations for natural remedies based on user input
Out of numerous innovative solutions, we were honored to be selected among the Top 5 Finalists! 🌟
This experience not only pushed our boundaries in AI and geolocation technologies but also highlighted the power of tech in promoting traditional, sustainable healthcare.
A big thanks to the organizers, mentors, and fellow participants who made this event unforgettable!
